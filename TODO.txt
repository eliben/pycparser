Version Update
--------------

pyproject.toml, pycparser/__init__.py, README

Building
--------

If the AST was modified `_c_ast.cfg`, make sure that `_ast_gen.py` was run and
`c_ast.py` is up to date.

Run:

    uv build

Copy the newly created tarball and untar it; check that the permissions of
Python files in the pycparser/ directory are OK.

Now create a new virtualenv and in it install the tarball with
`pip install <tarballname>`.

See that pycparser is importable in the Python interpreter of this virtualenv;
run pycparser tests from this virtualenv.

To upload to PyPI:

  $ uv publish dist/*

(can use ``--token``)

Check that `pip` can install and load pycparser from PyPI in this new version.

Tag in git. When pushing to GitHub, git push --tags
