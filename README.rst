Introduction
============

What is pycparser?
------------------

**pycparser** is a parser for the C language, written in pure Python. It is a
module designed to be easily integrated into applications that need to parse
C source code.

What is it good for?
--------------------

Anything that needs C code to be parsed. The following are some uses for
**pycparser**, taken from real user reports:

* C code obfuscator
* Front-end for various specialized C compilers
* Static code checker
* Automatic unit-test discovery
* Adding specialized extensions to the C language

**pycparser** is unique in the sense that it's written in pure Python - a very
high level language that's easy to experiment with and tweak. To people familiar
with Lex and Yacc, **pycparser**'s code will be simple to understand.


Which version of C does pycparser support?
------------------------------------------

**pycparser** aims to support the full C99 language (according to the standard
ISO/IEC 9899). This is a new feature in the version 2.x series - earlier
versions only supported C89.

**pycparser** doesn't support any GCC extensions. See the `FAQ
<https://github.com/eliben/pycparser/wiki/FAQ>`_ for more details.

What grammar does pycparser follow?
-----------------------------------

**pycparser** very closely follows the C grammar provided in the end of the C99
standard document

How is pycparser licensed?
--------------------------

`New BSD License <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php>`_

For reporting problems with **pycparser** or submitting feature requests, the
best way is to open an issue on the `pycparser project page

Installing
==========

Prerequisites
-------------

* **pycparser** was tested on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2, on both Linux and
  Windows. It should work on any later version (in both the 2.x and 3.x lines)
  as well.

* **pycparser** has no external dependencies. The only non-stdlib library it
  uses is PLY, which is bundled in ``pycparser/ply``. The current PLY version is
  3.4

Installation process
--------------------

Installing **pycparser** is very simple. Once you download and unzip the
package, you just have to execute the standard ``python setup.py install``. The
setup script will then place the ``pycparser`` module into ``site-packages`` in
your Python's installation library.

Alternatively, since **pycparser** is listed in the `Python Package Index
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycparser>`_ (PyPI), you can install it using your
favorite Python packaging/distribution tool, for example with::

    > pip install pycparser

Known problems
--------------

* Some users who've installed a new version of **pycparser** over an existing
  version ran into a problem using the newly installed library. This has to do
  with parse tables staying around as ``.pyc`` files from the older version. If
  you see unexplained errors from **pycparser** after an upgrade, remove it (by
  deleting the ``pycparser`` directory in your Python's ``site-packages``, or
  wherever you installed it) and install again.

Using
=====

Interaction with the C preprocessor
-----------------------------------

In order to be compilable, C code must be preprocessed by the C preprocessor -
``cpp``. ``cpp`` handles preprocessing directives like ``#include`` and
``#define``, removes comments, and does other minor tasks that prepare the C
code for compilation.

For all but the most trivial snippets of C code, **pycparser**, like a C
compiler, must receive preprocessed C code in order to function correctly. If
you import the top-level ``parse_file`` function from the **pycparser** package,
it will interact with ``cpp`` for you, as long as it's in your PATH, or you
provide a path to it.

On the vast majority of Linux systems, ``cpp`` is installed and is in the PATH.
If you're on Windows and don't have ``cpp`` somewhere, you can use the one
provided in the ``utils`` directory in **pycparser**'s distribution. This
``cpp`` executable was compiled from the `LCC distribution
<http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc/>`_, and is provided under LCC's
license terms.

What about the standard C library headers?
------------------------------------------

C code almost always includes various header files from the standard C library,
like ``stdio.h``. While, with some effort, **pycparser** can be made to parse
the standard headers from any C compiler, it's much simpler to use the provided
"fake" standard  includes in ``utils/fake_libc_include``. These are standard C
header files that contain only the bare necessities to allow valid parsing of
the files that use them. As a bonus, since they're minimal, it can significantly
improve the performance of parsing large C files.

The key point to understand here is that **pycparser** doesn't really care about
the semantics of types. It only needs to know whether some token encountered in
the source is a previously defined type. This is essential in order to be able
to parse C correctly.

See the ``using_cpp_libc.py`` example for more details.

Basic usage
-----------

Take a look at the ``examples`` directory of the distribution for a few examples
of using **pycparser**. These should be enough to get you started.

Advanced usage
--------------

The public interface of **pycparser** is well documented with comments in
``pycparser/c_parser.py``. For a detailed overview of the various AST nodes
created by the parser, see ``pycparser/_c_ast.cfg``.

There's also a `FAQ available here <https://github.com/eliben/pycparser/wiki/FAQ>`_.
In any case, you can always drop me an `email <eliben@gmail.com>`_ for help.

Modifying
=========

There are a few points to keep in mind when modifying **pycparser**:

* The code for **pycparser**'s AST nodes is automatically generated from a
  configuration file - ``_c_ast.cfg``, by ``_ast_gen.py``. If you modify the AST
  configuration, make sure to re-generate the code.
* Make sure you understand the optimized mode of **pycparser** - for that you
  must read the docstring in the constructor of the ``CParser`` class. For
  development you should create the parser without optimizations, so that it
  will regenerate the Yacc and Lex tables when you change the grammar.
